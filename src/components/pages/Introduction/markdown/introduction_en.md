<center># Welcome to PseuToPy!</center>

This site aims to facilitate the learning of programming for people who do not master English. Indeed, programming languages often use keywords in English which can complicate learning when it is not our native language. 
To overcome this problem we suggest you code in a pseudo language using keywords you know. 


You can already start programming in the [editor](#/editor) tab.

## Editor 

This screen is composed of 4 distinct parts:  
- The "Documentation" part: contains the examples of instructions  
- The "PseuToCode" part: is composed of your editor that you can then convert into Python  
- The "Python" part: displays the Python code resulting from your pseudo code and allows you to execute the code  
- The "Console" part: displays the console during the execution of the generated Python code
